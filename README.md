### Why we use static in Main Method in java

  The `static` keyword is used in the `main` method in Java for a few important reasons.
  Firstly, it allows the `main` method to be access directly by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without requiring an instance of the class.
  Secondly, it follows the convention set by Java for the entry point of a program, enabling the JVM to identify and execute it properly.
